## Project Setup

1. Clone this project to your desired directory
2. Install <strong>NodeJs</strong>
3. open the project and direct to Express directory
4. Run the of the following commands to install all the packages used to create this project
   - `npm install or yarn `

### Configuring Cloudinary
1. Navigate to App -> Cloudinary -> cloudinary.js
2. Create the same env names inside your .env file
3. Go [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com)
4. Create an account and login 
5. Choose NodeJs api 
6. Copy the api name, key and secret and paste along your variables name you have creted on .env file


### Configuring Email
1. Navigate to App -> Utils -> email.js
2. Create the same env names inside your .env file
3. Go google account to create as app passoword to avoid using your actual gmail passoword
4. Copy the api name, key and secret and paste along your variables name you have creted on .env file

N.B I'm using google account to send email, you can use any provided you git the actual port number and smtp address
for google account is:

`SMTP_HOST`:`smtp.gmail.com`,
`SMTP_PORT`:`587`,

## Running the project

1. Make sure to add a .env on the project `Express` and not `Chatting_Backend` file this is where you will save all your api keys and secrete keys
2. Navigate inside the your server directory
3. On your terminal run the following command
   - `node server.js`
4. Go to the browswer and enter
   - `http://localhost:8080/`
5. on the address bar to run the server


## Testing the project

1. As a new user you have to provide a real email address in receive emails and verify your account.
2. Always whenever you `login` or `forgot password`you will receive an email with An OTP Pin which you will need to provide to the application 
3. Once the OTP Pin has been verified you will receive a JWT token, and due to network issues you can request another OTP pin provided you send your email address used to register the application.

N.B Run `npm run start`. using this format the server won't automatically reload after doing changes because it runs the server as `node server.js`. 
Instead install `npm i -D nodemon or yarn add -D nodemon` then Run Server `npm run dev` The server will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. this way runs the server using nodemon `nodemon server.js`

To see all that got to `package.json` under `scripts` line 8 and 9 those are the commands set to runs the server.
If they are not set then run the server `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js` provided that nodemon has been installed.

N.B Navigate to server line 28, once your server is running change `sync` to `authenticted` and `true` to `false` by doing this is that your model won't overwrite the model created already in your database 

## API endpoint testing
Use postman or thunderclient to test your http request endpoints whether they are working or not 

Navigate to `App/Routes` thats where you will find all your endpoints combined with entry point on server line `43 - 46` and where your server is running for instance login will be `http://localhost:8080/api/login`
